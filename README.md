# Experimental-Evaluation-of-Binary-Representation-Variants-in-Genetic-Algorithm
experimental comparison of the performance of different approaches to the binary encoding of real numbers: standard fixed-point binary code and representation according to the IEEE 754 standard. Furthermore, the influence of the subsequent application of Gray coding to the fixed-point binary representation is examined
